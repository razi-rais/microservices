# Kubernetes Workshop

This repository contains setup instructions and hands-on labs for the [Kubernetes Workshop](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/building-microservices-using-kubernetes-hands-on-workshop-online-attendence-option-available-tickets-61595687359).
This workshop is led by [Razi Rais](https://www.linkedin.com/in/razirais)

## Prerequisites 
> Approximate time to complete this section is 10 minutes

In this training we will use [minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/minikube/) to run a local Kubernetes cluster. We will access this local Kubernetes cluster with the client tool  `kubectl`.

> NOTE: Following software are compatiable with Linux, Mac OS X and Windows operating system. During the minikube setup you will need to install a hypervisor that will run the minikube vm. It is reocmmended to use virtualbox as a hypervisor if possible. 

* Install [Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube). This setup includes step by step insructions to setup Minikube on a specefic operating system are availabe.
* Install [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/).This setup includes step by step insructions to setup minikube on a specefic operating system are availabe.

After successfull installation of minikube and kubectl verfiy the setup:
```
$ minikube version
minikube version: v1.0.1
```

Now, start the minikube. Please note that ```--vm-driver``` parameter is dependent on the type of hypervisor used during the minikube setup. Following example is using virtualbox as a hypervisor but you may need to change the value depending on your choice of the hypervisor.

```
$ minikube minikube start --vm-driver=virtualbox

Client Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"14", GitVersion:"v1.14.1", GitCommit:"b7394102d6ef778017f2ca4046abbaa23b88c290", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2019-04-19T22:12:47Z", GoVersion:"go1.12.4", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"darwin/amd64"}
Server Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"14", GitVersion:"v1.14.1", GitCommit:"b7394102d6ef778017f2ca4046abbaa23b88c290", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2019-04-08T17:02:58Z", GoVersion:"go1.12.1", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}
```

You can take minikube to a test drive right away to make sure things are working as expected! Let us run a nginx server in a kubernetes way.

```
$ kubectl run ngx --image=nginx --labels="type=webserver" 
```

Now run the command to see the pod running the nginx container.

```
$  kubectl get po -l type=webserver
NAME                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
ngx-5f48d9f7f5-xzxtz   1/1     Running   0          10s
```

Also, behind the scenes the run command created a Kubernetes deployment for you. 

```
$  kubectl get deployment ngx
NAME   READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
ngx    1/1     1            1           11s
```

Everthing is working as expected. Now you going to access the nginx using some form of a URL. After all its a webserver! In order to do that, first you need to expose the pod using the Kubernetes service. 

```
$ kubectl expose deployment ngx --type=NodePort --port=80 
```

Verify that service has been created successfully.
```
$kubectl get svc -l type=webserver -o wide
NAME   TYPE       CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE   SELECTOR
ngx    NodePort   10.106.191.246   <none>        80:32624/TCP   17s   type=webserver
```

With the service available you can get the URL to access the serice using an endpoint that will direct the traffic to the nginx pod!

```
$ minikube service ngx --url
http://192.168.99.102:32624
```
Now use curl/wget/browser to access the nginx.

```
$ curl $(minikube service ngx --url)
